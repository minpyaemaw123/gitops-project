# Staging Workflow for Terraform Code by GitHub Actions
---

Create the GitHub actions workflow in the repository **iac-vprofile**

```
cd iac-vprofile
mkdir -p .github/workflows
cd .github/workflows
touch terraform.yml
```

### pull_request:

A pull request is essentially a request to pull (i.e., merge) changes from one branch into another branch, typically from a feature branch into `main`. It's a crucial part of collaborative development, enabling code review, testing, and discussion before merging changes into the main code base.

### checkout:

The **checkout** step is essential in a GitHub Actions workflow because it retrieves the repository's source code and makes it available in the runner's environment. This allows the workflow to perform tasks like running Terraform commands, building the project, running tests, or deploying code. Without this step, the workflow wouldnâ€™t have the necessary context or files to execute its tasks.
***

- Commit and push terraform.yml to the repository
- Test the workflow by making changes in the repository and push to the remote repository.
- The workflow started showing up in Actions tab.
- Image
- I have issue with Terraform Versions, so I use 1.6.3 and the workflow stared working.
- Until now, "Terraform Plan" will only be executed when there are code pushes to main and stage
